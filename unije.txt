Unions are also sometimes used to implement pseudo-polymorphism in C,
 by giving a structure some tag indicating what type of object it contains,
  and then unioning the possible types together:

enum Type { INTS, FLOATS, DOUBLE };
struct S
{
  Type s_type;
  union
  {
    int s_ints[2];
    float s_floats[2];
    double s_double;
  };
};


Unions are often used to convert between the binary representations of integers and floats:

union
{
  int i;
  float f;
} u;

// Convert floating-point bits to integer:
u.f = 3.14159f;
printf("As integer: %08x\n", u.i);
