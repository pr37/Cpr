ISO 26262 is a safety standard for the automotive industry that provides guidelines for the development
 of safety-critical systems. It addresses the functional safety of electrical and/or electronic systems
 in passenger cars up to 3.5 tons. The standard defines four automotive safety integrity levels (ASILs)
 based on the severity of potential harm, and outlines the requirements and processes for achieving these
 levels of safety. The standard covers the entire product lifecycle, from concept and development through
 production, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning. It requires that all safety-related aspects of a
  system be identified and documented, and that measures be taken to ensure that these aspects are properly
  implemented, verified, and validated. The goal of ISO 26262 is to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries
  resulting from failures of safety-critical systems in cars.


  ISO 26262 applies to all safety-related systems in the automotive industry, including electronic control units (ECUs), sensors, actuators, and communication systems. Here are some examples of safety-critical systems in cars that must comply with the standard:

      Anti-lock braking systems (ABS): These systems prevent the wheels from locking up during hard braking, improving vehicle stability and control. ABS is considered safety-critical because it can affect the vehicle's ability to stop in an emergency.

      Adaptive cruise control (ACC): This system automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. ACC relies on sensors and actuators to control the throttle and brakes, making it safety-critical.

      Lane departure warning (LDW): This system alerts the driver if the vehicle is drifting out of its lane without a turn signal. LDW uses cameras or sensors to detect lane markings and is considered safety-critical because it can help prevent collisions.

      Electric power steering (EPS): This system replaces hydraulic power steering with an electric motor, providing improved fuel efficiency and easier handling. EPS is safety-critical because it affects the vehicle's steering and stability.

  These are just a few examples of safety-critical systems in cars that must meet the requirements of ISO 26262.


  There are four ASIL levels, each with different requirements for the level of risk mitigation:

      ASIL A: The lowest level of risk, where failure of the safety-critical function would result in only minor injuries or property damage.

      ASIL B: The risk level is higher than ASIL A, and failure of the safety-critical function could result in serious injuries or fatalities.

      ASIL C: The risk level is higher than ASIL B, and failure of the safety-critical function could result in severe or life-threatening injuries.

      ASIL D: The highest level of risk, where failure of the safety-critical function would result in catastrophic events, such as multiple fatalities or the loss of an entire vehicle.
